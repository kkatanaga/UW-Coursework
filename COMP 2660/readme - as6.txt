I recommend reading the source code while running the program. 
Each Activity is separated by comments in the source code, and when running, it will show the results and wait for any input before moving to the next Activity.
The results are mostly DumpRegs calls, and I've added comments on most of where the results are printed and what exactly they print.
There are sections where you can change the values for variables in each activity (i.e., val1, var1, varS1, etc.) so you don't have to change the .data directive every time.
