This lab was coded in replit. If you have issues testing the scripts and compilation, 
	please try uploading the files on replit and then running it using the terminal.
	
Using bash or cc works on the terminal of replit, without pressing Run.

The folder "build" contains the .o and .s files and the script "build_main.sh". You 
	can either move "build_main.sh" to the same directory as main.c and increment.c
	and run it, or simply move the .o and .s files if you need them.
